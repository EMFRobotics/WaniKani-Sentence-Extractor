# WaniKani-Sentence-Extractor
Making sentence cards on anki took me approximately 6 minutes per card ! This was far too long, so with a LOT of ChatGpt, I engineered a workflow to take the example sentences from WaniKani (comprehensible input), enable me to chat with AI, and create a flashcard for anki, all in the same place. This enables me to spend more time learning.
